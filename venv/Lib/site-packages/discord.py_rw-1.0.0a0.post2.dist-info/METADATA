discord.py-rw (Rewrite)
==========
discord.py is an API wrapper for Discord written in Python.

This was written to allow easier writing of bots or chat logs. Make sure to familiarise yourself with the API using the documentation http://discordpy.rtfd.org/en/latest.

Breaking Changes
---------------

The discord API is constantly changing and the wrapper API is as well. There will be no effort to keep backwards compatibility in versions before v1.0.0.

I recommend joining either the official discord.py server https://discord.gg/r3sSKJJ or the Discord API server https://discord.gg/discord-api for help and discussion about the library.

Installing
----------

To install the library without full voice support, you can just run the following command:


    python3 -m pip install -U discord.py-rw

Otherwise to get voice support you should run the following command:


    python3 -m pip install -U discord.py-rw[voice]


Please note that on Linux installing voice you must install the following packages via your favourite package manager (e.g. apt, yum, etc) before running the above command:

* libffi-dev (or libffi-devel on some systems)
* python-dev (e.g. python3.5-dev for Python 3.5)

Requirements
------------

* Python 3.5.3+
* aiohttp library
* websockets library
* PyNaCl library (optional, for voice only)

  - On Linux systems this requires the libffi library. You can install in
    debian based systems by doing sudo apt-get install libffi-dev.

Usually pip will handle these for you.
